#All is work

To start, need to shift the images "Сat.jpg" and "Noise.jpg" from the "scr" folder to the folder with the collected DisplayImage.exe.

It will be something like this "C:\Users\User\source\repos\CV_lab_self\bin\Release\DisplayImage.exe"

Start from console: DisplayImage.exe <image1> <image2>
• <image1> - All filters are applied to the image, except noise filtering.
• <image2> - Noise filter are applied to the image (image2 by default = "noise.jpg")
